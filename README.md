# MineSweeper
This is a fun project called Minesweeper. Minesweeper is a puzzle game that consists of a grid of cells, where some of the cells contain hidden mines. Clicking on a cell that contains a mine detonates the mine, and causes the user to lose the game. On the other hand, if you click on a "safe" cell(a cell that doesn't contain a mine) revels a number that indicates how many neighboring cells- where one of the cells around that cell contain a mine. 

# Objective
The objective of the game is to identify each of the mines. And I built an AI that can play Minesweeper. Using the concept of knoewledge, and how knowledge-based agents make decisions by considering their knowledge base, and making inferences based on that knowledge.
